Wolfgang Litzlbauer (sproing Vienna) - Get professional with HTML 5

7 years in game industry
a lot of impressive comsole games
last 3 years - web games

professional env
- JS (but not optimal for large codebases - hard to master)
- diffrent languages? (Closure Compiler, Coffee Script, Dart, TypeScript, GWT)
- C++ to JS compiler (via LLVM)

They use GWT + Eclipse for web projects

Pure JS Engines
- Play Canvas
- Pixi.js

PlayN - subsystem
- still early state
- good platform abstraction

best practices
- not support IE8 (Canvas)
- webGL still not optimal for multi platform
- problematic on tablets
- it's a future
render full screen quickly
make animation scalable
- full on desktop 
- minimal on tablets
FPS is not everuything
Think native
- game must be listed in the AppStore
- Packing tools tools like PhoneGap reduce game perf (dramatically)
- use PlayN
Expect the unexpective

game: http://battleofcrowns.com looks really nice (only in German, but will be trabnslate soon)
