why HTML5?
- small team
- develop once

- tech savyy

* QUESTION: what are you experience with Smart TV Alliance ?

- ultimate.js
- low-level:
 > OOP Java style
 > DOM based , not using Canvas
 > GUI components

 > postresSQL
 > same entities classes as in clients

- screen resolutions

- spaceport, phonegap, cocoon, mosync, marmalade, appMobi(!)
- HTML overheads
 > ineffective gtaphics management (slow positionnigs, string-bases type conversion, heavy html4 legacy)
 > low objects scaling efficiency (more objects = more lags)

- problems
 > differenc ways to build eficient bridge between js and native (windows phone - fast js from natvie, very slow native calls from js, slow js from native)
 > difference between internal work od DOM (windows Phone and Android)
 > which js interpreter to use?

- solutions
 > push as many data as we can (without direct rewuest) to js from native on windows phone,
 and pull as many data as we can on Android
 > caching DOM objects ----- how?
 > using stock web browser as js interpreters only
