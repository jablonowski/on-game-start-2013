WebGL performance tips - Nicolas Silva
======================================

- WebGL high lvl API and low lvl API
- Both FF & Chrome use
 > on mobile: openGL ES2
 > on Mac & Linux: "desktop" OpenGL
 > On Windows: OpenGL ES2 (throught ANGLE - > Direct3D)
- ANGLE also provides with shader translation/validation on all platforms
- WebGL tries to pipeline commands as much as posiisble
- A point of synchronization can block the JS thread for a long time
- for instance: gl.getErrors(), gl.readPixels(), gl.finish()
- data transfe f between CPI and GPU is slow
 > texture uploads, vertex buffers,
- cache gets calls like gl.getParameter(), gl.getUniformLocation()
- avoid gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(program, "time"), time);
- generally the most important optimization!
- state changes are expensive (texture bindings, shaders)
- pack all the eometry that share the same states togethe in the samoe drawing commangds
- pack seceral textures nifo one, and select the approprtae region with texture coordinates
- shaders - highly parallel execution
- compile in GPU 
- we can render worlds in two trangles
- DEMO: http://nical.github.com/GLSL-Ratmarching/demo/webgl/raymarcher.html
- Branching is slow
if (foo < 0.5) {
 // do A...
} else {
 // do B...
}
- often the cost of computing both A and B
- coherency usually  improves performance
- CPU cache locality 
- for the texture cache, proximity is considered in 2D
- cache misses are expensive
- mip mapping - from big image to small without mistakes in redered
- warning: shader compile times
- shader compilation si synchronous
- very heavy shaders can block the browser for sever seconds on some drivers
- DEMO: shadertoy.com
- avoid high presicion floats in fragment shaders (mobile gardware dont support it)
* QUESTION: what's is the most famous tool of debugging WebGL which you use?
- use gl.finish() (but not in production!) ----- ;)
- GPU is not a silver bullet 
- GPU is good at doing some specific operations
- its not good fo:
 > rendering text
 > vector shapes in general (bezier curves)
 > processing that is sequencial by nature
- js that calls info webGL runs in the same thread as layout and most of web content
- means other things can block yout games's thread
- WebGL workers \o/ ---------- ;)
- security - OpenGL  specifications have beahvios left undefined to acheve the best performance
- on the wev we cannot
